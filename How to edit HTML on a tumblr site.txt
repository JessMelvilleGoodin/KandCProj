Awwww snap! Sorry for the deluge of emails. I think I figured it out, though!!
Here’s what I *think* I should do to get that HTML up onto her site:


Log in using the credentials she provided me

Click on the “Settings” gear

Website theme: Edit Theme

scroll down on the options menu on the left and select the press page (or create a page for it, but that would be more complicated with linking , etc)

Choose “Custom Layout” from the dropdown menu on the left

paste the HTML (including the styles) into the text field

hit save! 

Voila! I think that’s it 😊



DO NOT JUST PASTE YOUR  HTML INTO THE THEME BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE EVERY PAGE THE SAME CONENT!!!
