Hi! Here's what I'd love for each box to read (I noted places where it should be the same as what's on the current press page, not what is on the samples you sent). Sorry for some weird formatting here—I'm using Gmail and am not familiar with how to reformat.

Let me know if you have any questions!


Thanks so much,
